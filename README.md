# AntiPython-AI-Club
AI community for people who dislike Python.

## Background
Getting into AI as a hobbyist/professional is my dream. I understand the Math and the algorithms. However, I struggle most with Python. 
\
I really hate Python. I hate indentation errors. I hate using Pip. I hate creating virtual enviroments just so numpy works. I hate that Python tutorials written 1 year ago won't run because of library changes. I hate that I have to use Kubernetes, Docker and a million other things to deploy trained AI models.  

## How it works
Every week, we implement AI algorithms in our **favorite programming languages**. We start together and finish together.

## Week 1
 - Building a neural network by hand using pencil and paper.
## Week 2
 - Building a matrix arithmetic library.
## Week 3 
 - Building a neural network using our library.
## Week 4
 - Implementing an arxiv paper.
## Week 5
 - Implementing Stable Diffusion / LLama or anything of your choice.
